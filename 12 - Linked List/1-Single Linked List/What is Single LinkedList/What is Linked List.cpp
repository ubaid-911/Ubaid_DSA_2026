🚀 Why Linked List? (Simple & Clear Answer)
✅ 1. Dynamic Size
In array, size is fixed.

In linked list, you can grow or shrink anytime.

No need to worry about "array size full".



✅ 2. Easy Insertion & Deletion
Insert/delete at beginning or middle is very fast.

Only change pointers, no shifting like arrays.


⚠️ But Linked List also has disadvantages
No direct access (you cannot jump to index 5 directly).

Takes more memory (because of pointers).

Slower to search compared to array.
